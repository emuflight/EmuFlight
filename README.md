This is **EgoFlight**. A fork of EgoFight, err [EmuFlight](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight).

This fork differs from EmuFlight:

 * Not a bird ü¶â
 * Most flight control related features disabled (can be enabled) ‚úÇÔ∏è
 * Opinionated defaults üß™
 * Different branding ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

## Motivation
 
 * Reduce complexity of flight control
 * Ease of tuning efforts
 * Cherry-pick upstream changes
 * Do not believe the hype

## Features

**EgoFlight** has no features. It's all about __you__.

## Documentation

None.

## Support and Developers Channel

Nah.

## Configuration Tool

No way.

Use

 * `OSD` - fiddle sticks
 * `LUA` - gives you pain
 * [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator) for flashing and `CLI` - **pro** way of having a ego
