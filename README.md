This is **EgoFlight**. A fork of EgoFight, err [EmuFlight](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight).

This fork differs from EmuFlight:

 * not a bird 🦉
 * most flight control related features disabled (can be enabled) ✂️
 * opinionated defaults 🧪
 * different branding ™️

## Features

EgoFlight has no features. It's all about you.

## Documentation

None.

## Support and Developers Channel

Nah.

## Configuration Tool

No way.

Use

 * `OSD` - fiddle sticks
 * `LUA` - gives you pain
 * [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator) for flashing and `CLI` - **pro** way of having a ego
