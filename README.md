# EgoFlight

A fork of EgoFight, err [EmuFlight](https://github.com/emuflight/EmuFlight).

> This is not a joke, but actually a flying fork.

## Fork

This one differs from EmuFlight:

 * Not a bird ü¶â
 * Most flight control related features disabled (can be enabled) ‚úÇÔ∏è
 * Opinionated defaults üß™
 * Different branding ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

## Changes
 
 * Reduce complexity of flight control
   * `pid.c` defaults changed
   * `gyro.c` defaults changed
   * `rc_controls.c` defaults changed (just "deadband")
 * Ease of tuning efforts
   * Enable features selectively when required, not because some other ego feels like it
 * Cherry-pick upstream changes (new bling)
 * Do not believe the hype ('church of bardwell')

## Documentation

None.

## Support and Developers Channel

Nah.

## Configuration Tool

No way.

Use

 * `OSD` - fiddle sticks
 * `LUA` - gives you pain
 * [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator) for flashing and `CLI` - **pro** way of having a ego
