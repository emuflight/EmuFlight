/*
 * The idea is simple, run a passband at the notch frequency to isolate noise
 * at the notch frequency. Then look at the averaged squared rate of change over
 * a period of time great enough to cover at least 1 full wave of noise at notch
 * frequency. This way we can measure noise and compare noise of pre/post notch.
 * this allows us to crossfade based on noise.
