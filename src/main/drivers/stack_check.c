/*
 * The ARM processor uses a full descending stack. This means the stack pointer holds the address
 * of the last stacked item in memory. When the processor pushes a new item onto the stack,
 * it decrements the stack pointer and then writes the item to the new memory location.
 *
 *
 * RAM layout is generally as below, although some targets vary
 *
 * F1 Boards
 * RAM is origin 0x20000000 length 20K that is:
 * 0x20000000 to 0x20005000
 *
 * F3 Boards
 * RAM is origin 0x20000000 length 40K that is:
 * 0x20000000 to 0x2000a000

 * F4 Boards
 * RAM is origin 0x20000000 length 128K that is:
