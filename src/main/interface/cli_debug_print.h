// Provides: cliPrintDebug... functions for displaying debugging information in the CLI
//
// Usage: Make sure USE_CLI_DEBUG_PRINT is defined
//        Include this header in your code
//        Add cliDebugPrint... statements as needed in your code
//        Use the CLI to see the output of the debugging statements
//
// Cautions: Be sure to include rate limiting logic to your debug printing
//           if needed otherwise you can flood the output.
//
//           Be sure to reverse the Usage steps above to remove the debugging
//           elements before submitting final code.
