## If you are sure there is an issue with the firmware itself please follow these steps:

1. Describe your problem
2. Include ways to reproduce the problem
3. Provide as much information as possible about your hardware and software, including:
 - what hardware / software you are using
 - the version of all the software used
 - how things are connected / wired up
4. Create a `diff` and post it here in a code block. Put ``` (three backticks) at the start and end of the `diff` block (instructions on how to do a diff: https://oscarliang.com/use-diff-not-dump-betaflight/)
5. Remove this Text :)
